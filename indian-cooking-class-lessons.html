<p>Indian food is magical to me. I mean these folks have been making delicious, interesting, rich&#xa0;vegetarian food for centuries and if you're anything like me, attempting to recreate it at home&#xa0;didn't always turn out as hoped. </p><p>It's one of the first cuisines I was really keen to learn, and here&#xa0;I am 10 years later, still trying to figure out the secrets. To me Indian food can be intimidating,&#xa0;hard to get right and time consuming. </p><p>Especially since I've asked multiple friends of mine who&#xa0;are Indian for pointers or recipes and they all have the "little bit of this, little bit of that" model for&#xa0;spicing, i.e. not the easiest thing to replicate. ;)</p>
<div class="ImageBlock ImageBlockLeft"><img src="images/indiancookingclass_me_naveen.jpg" width="665"></div>
<p>So, all that to say that when Evan and I went on our grand Asian adventure, and decided to start&#xa0;our journey in India, an authentic cooking lesson was high on my must-do list.&#xa0;</p><p>We had a great experience in an almost full-day class, which was just our teacher and the two&#xa0;of us in his family's home, in his real kitchen finally learning the secrets to successful Indian&#xa0;cooking. Here's my recap!</p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><em>*Note: We took our class in Northern India where the food was heavily influenced by the&#xa0;Mughlai people. From what I understand, there are many regional differences in Indian food.&#xa0;That being said, the large majority of Indian restaurants in North America serve Northern Indian&#xa0;food.&#xa0;</em></span><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><em>Also, what's written below reflects what we learned from our experience. I'm sure there are&#xa0;a million and one different ways to do things and any observations had were specific to our&#xa0;wonderful cooking instructor and his welcoming, humble abode.&#xa0;</em></span></p>
<h2>1. Home cooking is the norm</h2>
<p>Man, I was so impressed by how many people cook and eat&#xa0;homemade meals! Sometimes it seems like a near novelty to make something from scratch in the U.S. but it's humbling to see this is a multiple-time-a-day occurrence for many Indian families. </p><p>I love&#xa0;the pride too! Everyone either thought they were the best cook or their mom/wife/sister was :D&#xa0;I also heard that even for busy business employees who don't have time to make their own&#xa0;food, instead of going to a restaurant for lunch, there is a whole network of people who make&#xa0;homemade food and deliver it to offices. So cool!<br/></p>
<div class="ImageBlock ImageBlockCenter"><img src="images/indiacookingclass_onions.jpg" width="1025"></div>
<h2>2. Oil, so much oil</h2>
<p>While cooking from home normally means it's a bit healthier than eating&#xa0;out, the amount of oil our cooking instructor used was downright sinful. </p><p>I don't think I've ever&#xa0;used even half that much oil in one dish before (though I'm certain I've eaten it at restaurants!). He told us it was a cup but I think it was at least two. </p><p>I guess that's one way to ensure a rich&#xa0;taste. I can't wait to try out the recipes we learned only with a fraction of the oil - hopefully it still&#xa0;tastes good with less. :)<br/></p>
<div class="ImageBlock ImageBlockCenter"><img src="images/CreamyCurrygrid.jpg" width="911"></div>
<h2>3. No cream required for creamy gravy</h2>
<p>This is my favorite tip I learned during our&#xa0;class and one I will surely be applying at home. Our instructor taught us that for a creamy gravy&#xa0;that doesn't have cream, puree&#xa0;sautéed&#xa0;veggies and onions to make a thick sauce. </p><p>We started&#xa0;off by cooking up some onions, tomatoes, garlic and spices, you know...the basics, then once&#xa0;those were to his liking, he plopped them in a small blender and pureed them all together and&#xa0;put the now sauce back in the wok to finish out the curry. </p><p>Awesome! I can make a luscious, saucey curry all from a veggie base - now that's what I wanted to hear!<br/></p>
<h2>4. You don't need a tandoor oven</h2>
<p>Prior to going to Indian I heard stories of the tandoor,&#xa0;which is supposed to be a wood/charcoal burning, cylindrical, clay oven in which flat breads and&#xa0;meats are cooked. </p><p>They always seems so exotic and maybe a little daunting, not to mention out&#xa0;of the question for practical purposes. I thought naan had to be made this way. </p><p>That's why I was&#xa0;pleasantly surprised when our guru made the bread dough and started cooking the naan right&#xa0;on his burner. Genius. </p><p>He had a gas flame stove top and even though he assured us it could be&#xa0;made atop an electric stove just as well, we'll have to see how that turns out. I'll report back.&#xa0;<br/></p>
<div class="ImageBlock ImageBlockLeft"><img src="images/indiancookingclasstea.jpg" width="650"></div>
<hr style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#ffffff;border-style:solid;">
<h2>5. Garam Masala: More to it than the U.S. blend</h2>
<p>When looking&#xa0;up garam masala mixtures in the past, or buying the pre-mixed spice blend from the store, it&#xa0;usually was composed of cardamom, black pepper and cinnamon. Maybe a pinch of cloves.&#xa0;</p><p>Well well well, the blend used by actual Indians has so much more to it! The list our teacher&#xa0;gave me had black pepper, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, mango powder, bay leaves, nutmeg,&#xa0;cloves, black cardamom, dried ginger and cinnamon. </p><p>Of course no quantities or proportions&#xa0;were given ;) but now I know why my dishes often lacked dimension.<br/></p>
<h2>6. Most of my favorite curries have the same base</h2>
<p>Maybe this isn't that surprising but most&#xa0;of the Indian curries I like best have something in common. By which I mean to say they are&#xa0;the same curry with different veggies mixed in, hah. </p><p>If you like those unctuous tomatoey dishes&#xa0;where some come with mushrooms and peas, some come with carrots and green beans, some&#xa0;with potatoes and cauliflower, you'll be happy to know you just have to know how to make&#xa0;one sauce and then throw whatever you want in. </p><p>And if you aren't vegan add a bit of milk and&#xa0;paneer cubes and bam, even more options. All one great dish. It made me a little disappointed&#xa0;by the lack of range in my Indian palette but also quite pleased I only have to work on mastering&#xa0;one thing, lol.&#xa0;<br/></p>
<div class="ImageBlock ImageBlockCenter"><img src="images/EvanSamosagrid.jpg" width="670"></div>
<h2>7. "Don't be too clean or the food won't taste good"</h2>
<p>Funny story: Evan an I were trading off,&#xa0;one of us would jot down recipes and advice in our notebook and take pictures while the other&#xa0;would be hands on prepping and cooking. </p><p>Because we kept going back and forth handling our&#xa0;phones and paper and then the raw vegetables, we kept using our hand sanitizer in between.&#xa0;</p><p>After several rounds of this dance our teacher stopped us and said "You're going to ruin the&#xa0;food. You can't be too clean or the food won't have flavor. Too clean and it won't taste good."&#xa0;Hah. </p><p>Duly noted. We stopped being such OCD westerners after that but I am glad everything&#xa0;was cooked with high heat.&#xa0;<br/></p>
<h2>8. People eat late</h2>
<p>One night in Delhi we went out to dinner with a friend of ours who was&#xa0;born and raised there.</p><p> Well let me rephrase that, we met at 6:30, Evan and I were starving for&#xa0;dinner (we are such old fogies) and when we found our friend he wanted to walk around for&#xa0;an hour because it was way too early to eat. </p><p>Eventually he gave in and we started picking his&#xa0;brain on the time table most people ate dinner. He said "Oh anywhere from 7:30 to 10ish". </p><p>It&#xa0;being around 7:30 at that time we said "Okay so this is sort of a normal time for dinner..." He&#xa0;said "Nooo, no one eats before 9." Haha.<br/></p>
<div class="ImageBlock ImageBlockCenter"><img src="images/indiancookingclasskitchen.jpg" width="747"></div>
<h2>9. Kitchen resourcefulness to the max</h2>
<p>I saved this one for last because it&#xa0;was arguably the biggest difference between how I cook when I'm at home and how we did&#xa0;it in our cooking class. It doesn't have to do with the ingredients but the kitchen.</p><p>The space was tiny,&#xa0;maybe the size of a laundry room in a middle-class home in the U.S. It had a faucet-less sink&#xa0;and a tap near the floor with a bucket. The pot of milk was left out on the counter.</p><p>Our food prep area was the top of a washing machine next to their pet bird's cage, next to a laundry line with&#xa0;clothes drying all underneath an open roof where rain could come in. Our teacher used plates&#xa0;of chopped veggies as a flat surface to hold other plates of prepped spices.</p><p>There was no oven,&#xa0;no microwave. The fridge was in the other room. Even though going in I didn't know how all&#xa0;three of us would work in there making food for hours, somehow it all worked. I respected it.</p>
<div class="ImageBlock ImageBlockCenter"><img src="images/indiacookingclass_bird.jpg" width="801"></div>
<p>It&#xa0;was a humbling reminder of how little we actually need to get by. And not only get by but thrive&#xa0;and make delicious, mouth-watering goodies. While it never would pass a food safety inspection&#xa0;in the U.S. it made me appreciate how many different ways there are to do something, and&#xa0;think maybe that's not as important as we make it out to be (see #7).<br/></p><p>It made me laugh at times&#xa0;back home when I felt like I didn't have "the right" utensil/pot/dish etc. to get the job done. It also&#xa0;made me appreciate everything I do have. </p><p>Spending several hours in our instructor's&#xa0;kitchen provided me with every emotion I always hoped to feel by traveling: how important it&#xa0;is to keep an open mind, simultaneously impressed and intrigued by a different way of life,&#xa0;appreciative and grateful, and a sense that none of it really matters, that at he end of the day&#xa0;we're all similar. </p><p>And that's why I love food, like a smile it is timeless and spans cultures, ages and genders to unite us all.<br/></p>
